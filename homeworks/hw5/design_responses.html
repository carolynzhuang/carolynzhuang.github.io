                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned that there are many different types of designs and animations that can be used for UI. Some are more central to the website, involving videos and graphic animations, while others are more functional and appear when searching/using a part of the website. These animations can really help elevate the quality of the website.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>My favorite part about the article was looking at all the different animations. I really like animations in websites, as they improve UX and overall increase engagement and interest. I definitely hope to implement animations like these in future designs.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>My favorite animation was the Index&Sidebar animation. This included two main features: one that automatically centers the next credit card when scrolling, and one that has a maximizing/minimizing effect when opening the menu tab. Although they are both minor changes, they have a large impact on the user experience, as it makes the interface more fluid. It also makes sure that the current credit card is always at the center, minimizing the effort required to search for a card.</p>
