							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked this article's information, as it was very specific about attention and the principles linked to it. For example, it went over each type of attention, ideas that I had heard of before, but it was nice to see it all laid out together. I also liked how it gave some suggestions for how to improve design. However, they could've included some examples of design that utilized their suggestions to make their point more clear.</p>
