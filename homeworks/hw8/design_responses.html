				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I learned about different dark design patterns that companies use to trick users. For example, LinkedIn used friend spamming, where a company spams all of your contacts after obtaining your email/social media, and LinkedIn actually got sued for that. Another example is Privacy Zuckering, where the user is tricked into sharing more information than they intended to.</p>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>My favorite part about the article was that they gave examples for each type of dark design. I had basically encountered all of them, so it was interesting to see the methods behind each tactic. I also like how they proposed some "solutions" to dark design, and even though the solutions cannot entirely solve the problem, they were interesting to read about.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>"Industry insiders like Bunker (2013) have suggested that designers should have an ethical code of conduct where privacy, honesty and respect should be the core elements."</p>
					</li>
