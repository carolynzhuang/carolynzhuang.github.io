            Hi, I'm Carolyn! I'm from Richmond, VA. I don't have much to say about myself but I like watermelon and taking naps. I'm also pretty good at Word Hunt but unfortunately kind of addicted to it.

        <h2>Article questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned that it is important to be aware of design choices when using platforms, such as well-known apps. I also learned that even the seemingly inconsequential design choices are there for a reason and that I should be intentional with all of my designs.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was when the author broke down the specific design choices of apps. I never really paid attention to those details before, but I will definitely take not of them in the future.</li>
            <li>"I want to hear from you! Feel free to reach out and let me know your thoughts. I'm here to help ☺️ And if you want more thoughts on this topic, visit Hack Design and check out my lesson on Closing the Creative Gap."</li>
