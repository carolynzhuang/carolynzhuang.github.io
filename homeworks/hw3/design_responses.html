						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned about many resources to find fonds, like the WhatFont Chrome extension, which will definitely be useful in the future. I also did not know that there was so much math involved in choosing type fonts. For example, there are different ratios/scales that can be used to determine what set of font sizes to use, which is really interesting.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of the article was learning about resources to find fonts. Not only did the article give websites to find many fonts, it also gave ideas on how to pair fonts, something I usually struggle with. Also, there have been multiple occasions where I want to find a font from a website but do not know what it is, and the WhatFont extension solves that problem.</p>
