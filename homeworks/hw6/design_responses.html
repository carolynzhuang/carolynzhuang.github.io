					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that animations should generally follow laws of physics. This makes sense now that the article laid it out, since we are more accustomed to what we see in the real world. However, this does mean that animations have to be more detailed in terms of their movement and time.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part about the article was how detailed it was. It was very nice to see the good and bad animations laid out next to each other, as well as different options for each part of animation. Overall, this will be a good reference for the future.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users."</p>
						</li>
